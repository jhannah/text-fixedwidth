Revision history for Text-FixedWidth

0.12    2013-07-25 jhannah
        - Added optional 'writer' subs to set_attribute for when you need to do
          magic when setting attributes. 

0.11    2013-06-09 jhannah
        - Added set_attribute(), which allows anonymous subs to be set into 'reader'
          for when simple sprintf 'format' attributes prove insufficiently flexible.

        - Found another instance of the warning below. Now tests for "" and undef.

0.05    2009-04-29 jhannah
        - Suppress spurious warnings when at attribute is explicitly set to undef.

          attribute that doesn't exit.
